# README: Exploratory Data Analysis of Posey Database

## Project Overview
This analysis focuses on exploring key insights and visualizations from the Posey database, analyzing patterns, trends, and actionable insights to help guide decision-making.

### Key Insights and Visualizations:
- **Data Sources Analyzed:**
  - **Orders Table:** Contains records of each order, including order ID, account ID, date/time, product quantities, and total amount spent.
  - **Accounts Table:** Holds details on 351 accounts, such as ID, name, website, location, point of contact, and sales representative.
  - **Sales Reps Table:** Contains information about 50 sales reps, including ID, name, and region.
  - **Region Table:** Lists different regions.
  - **Web Event Table:** Holds 9073 records of web events for specific accounts, including occurrence time and channel used.

### Analysis and Key Findings:
- **Monthly Orders Growth (2013â€“2017):** The average number of monthly orders quadrupled from 90 in 2013 to 360 in 2017, indicating increased demand and sales activity.
- **Sales Seasonality:** Over the 2014-2016 period, sales consistently grew throughout the year, peaking towards the end of each year, likely due to holiday consumer behavior.
- **Website Performance:**
  - "www.honeywell.com" is a standout, generating more than $70,000, far above other websites. There is a strong opportunity to replicate the success of high-performing websites by analyzing their marketing, content, and user experience strategies.
- **Top Performing Accounts:**
  - **Health Net** outperformed all other accounts by a significant margin. Other key accounts like **PBF Energy** and **NextEra Energy** also stood out with high total sales.
- **Sales Performance by Region:**
  - The **Northeast region** had the highest total sales, while the **Midwest region** underperformed significantly.
- **Sales Representative Performance:**
  - **Tia Amato** led as the top-performing sales rep, followed by **Elba Felder** and **Arica Stoltzfus**. Representatives like **Akilah Drinkard** and **Caralee Bidwell** performed below expectations.

### Actionable Insights:
- **Replicate Top Performer Strategies:** Understand the success of websites like "www.honeywell.com" and accounts like Health Net to improve underperforming sites and names.
- **Improve Midwest Region Performance:** Investigate why the Midwest region is underperforming and consider strategies to drive more sales in that region.
- **Develop Sales Team:** Provide training and performance coaching to sales representatives who are lagging behind to help improve their numbers.
- **Focus on Seasonal Trends:** Tailor marketing and sales strategies to align with seasonal consumer behavior, especially around year-end peaks.

### Next Steps:
1. Investigate top-performing websites, accounts, and sales representatives to understand success factors.
2. Implement targeted strategies to enhance the performance of underperforming regions, websites, and sales representatives.
3. Continue driving growth in high-performing regions and accounts while maintaining strong performance levels.
